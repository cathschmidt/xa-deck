            <h2>The internet changed how we communicate. Now it&#8217;s changing how we create and capture value.</h2>
            <p>Brief visualization showing evolution: Communication Networks → Social Networks → Economic Networks</p>
            <p>Clear statement of the massive opportunity this represents</p>

                    <p>Today's networks create enormous value through relationships and connections,but we're still using economic tools designed for local, isolated transactions.</p>
                    <p>This mismatch leads to value being lost or captured inefficiently</p>
