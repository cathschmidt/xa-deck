While decentralizing state replication, blockchain re-centralizes economic meaning around a rigid, monolithic grammar ("one ledger, one coin"), struggling to express economic-organizationally anything else. In other words, blockchains solved centralization of state but not of economic logic and agency.</td>

Network agents become active authors of their economic reality.</td>
